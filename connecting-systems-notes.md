### Client side request/response
The basis of web interactions, is asking for information, and recieving information. The "asker" is the a **client**, and the respondent is the **server**. Clients send Requests to Servers asking for some kind of information. Upon receiving a Request, Servers send Responses back to the Client.
This pattern of communication is described by the request-response model:
1. Client sends a request
* The client (usually a web browser or an application) initiates the communication by sending an HTTP request to a specific URL or endpoint on the server.
* The request includes the HTTP method (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that indicates the desired action to be performed on the server, along with additional headers and sometimes a message body containing data.

2. Server parses the request
* The browser first takes the URL enetered and parses it to understand its componenets:
     As an example: http://google.com/path/to/resource/?query=param
    * protocol (http:// or https://)
    * domain name (i.e. google.com)
    * path (i.e. /path/to/resource/)
    * query parameters (?query=param)

3. DNS resolution
The browser needs to find the IP address that corresponds to the domain name. It sends a request to the Domain Name System (DNS) server to resolve the domain name into an IP address.
Then, the DNS responds to the request with the IP address of the server hosting the requested URL. DNS is often called the 'phonebook of the internet'.

4. Establishing connection
* Once the browser receives the IP address, it tries to establish connection with the hosting server. For https, this involves an additional step to create a secure connection via SSL/TCP.
    * Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented protocol for communications that helps in the exchange of messages between different devices over a network.
    * SSL is standard technology for securing an internet connection by encrypting data sent between a website and a browser. SSL uses certificates that contain a public key that authenticates the websiteâ€™s identity and allows for encrypted data transfer through asymmetric, or public-key cryptography.
